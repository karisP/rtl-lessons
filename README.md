# Getting Started

After cloning the project:

### `npm install`

I highly recommend that you start by watching this course to give you foundational understanding of RTL. [React Testing Library Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04BBgg8zgWo)

There are several folders in the src directory labeled LevelOne, LevelTwo..etc.

Start with LevelOne and read the markdown file for the instructions.

Complete the tests according to the acceptance criteria in each level before moving on to the next one.

There is a submissions folder available if you need suggestions from other people's answers. If you would like to add to the submissions folder, copy your test file into the submissions folder and add your initials to the file. For instance `LevelOne_KP.test.tsx` would be mine, then remove your own changes from the original `LevelOne.test.tsx` and a create PR.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Runs all test files.
